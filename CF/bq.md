####  The biggest mistake you made and what did you learn from it?  (earn trust, customer obsession)
- English. I have learned that from the experiences, should to find a reason, the potential, and a motivation when encounter the challenge. For example during the work, if the team assign a task to me which I have no clue, even think it does't make any sense. I should to communicate with the team to figur out the reason the potential of the task, and give a motivation to self. Not just deny it since mostly I just don't able to see the potential at the time and should trust the team.
- Treated customer requirement with neglect. A CE told me a requirement from a VIP customer since tech leader of my team was taking vocation. Basically, the customer would like to see top n comsuming buckets and top n busy traffic buckets on the board real time. BTW, my team is Metering team. So the requirement comes to our team obviously. Honestly, at the beginning I think we cannot take all requirements from customer. since some requirements will hurt Metering service perforamance. So I didn't pay attention to the requirements at the time. Basically, I Treated customer requirement with neglect. Then when I was hang out with mentor when I was intern, I mentioned the story. Fortunately, he told me I was wrong and told since my team leader was not at office. I can communicate with team not only Metering even other teams to listen the suggestions the ideas from my team and other teams. Fortunately, in the end I came up a good approach which custrom aggred and i implemented it.
Basically, the approach is eventually consistence not real time to demonstrate the top N. BTW, you can see the experience/ feature in my resume.

#### OWNERSHIP: Give me a example of when you took a risk and it failed.
leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “That’s not my job”.

#### INVENT AND SIMPLIFY: Tell me a time when you created an innovative product.
Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by "not invented here". As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.

- In my opinion that first of all I should to figure out why the team member has poor performermance.
- Reason: don't know how to do -> help them., procrastination, or don't care about the project, or don't like.  
- The team member is don't care about the project. hang out with him, have a talking with him. to be frient, he is changeing since our relationship.

#### INSIST ON THE HIGHEST STANDARDS: Tell me about a time when you could have stopped working but persisted.
Leaders  have relentlessly high standards - many people may think these standards are unreasonably high.

- case 1: Intership Experience: 2 months completed two projects. After I completed the first project in 1 month and few days. My mentoer didn't ask me do another one.

- When I was TA what I did. At the time I was busy, since I was taking 7 courses a semester. I will figour out the priority first, If the question is not urgent, such as it's going to dues soon. then I will provide learning materials to the student first.
