Hi, I am Fan Zhou graduated from WSU. have been in EMC for the past almost 1 year, have been working on a number of new features in the metering service in Java. I have been working on embedded system in C for two years in China. 
Hopefully my experience can help our team in future.

I am really looking forward to getting the opportunity to work with each of you and have you join our team.  I was hoping to have the opportunity to get you all together this week to give a brief introduction to my current team.  Unfortunately timing didn’t quite work out due to training and a folks out on PTO.  Because I will be out in training for 2.5 days next week, I will be setting up 1:1s for each of you mid to late next week.  Additionally, I will take the opportunity to have a sync up with your manager to ensure there is a clear transition plan/hand-off between us in completing current team commitments/deliverables.  In preparation for our 1:1 discussion next week, I’d like you to think about the following questions to gather your thoughts on what you’d like me to know about you:
