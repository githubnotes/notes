Hi, I am Fan Zhou graduated from WSU. have been in EMC for the past almost 1 year, have been working on a number of new features in the metering service in Java. I have been working on embedded system in C for two years in China. 
Hopefully my experience can help our team in future.

I have been reading the wiki from isilone such as one file system, and reviewing C language which can help me to start the new tasks quickly. And spend some time to help pre-team to finish the new feature which was impled by us. 

All,
 
I am really looking forward to getting the opportunity to work with each of you and have you join our team.  I was hoping to have the opportunity to get you all together this week to give a brief introduction to my current team.  Unfortunately timing didn’t quite work out due to training and a folks out on PTO.  Because I will be out in training for 2.5 days next week, I will be setting up 1:1s for each of you mid to late next week.  Additionally, I will take the opportunity to have a sync up with your manager to ensure there is a clear transition plan/hand-off between us in completing current team commitments/deliverables.  In preparation for our 1:1 discussion next week, I’d like you to think about the following questions to gather your thoughts on what you’d like me to know about you:
 
Do you have a 5/10 year plan?  Where do you see yourself in 5 years?
How do you like to be recognized?
What motivates you to come to work?
What experiences do you have that you’d like to share with me?
What do you think are your key strengths?
Where are the areas that you feel you have opportunities for growth?
As your leader/manager what would you like to share with me to help you achieve your career goals?

·       Self-Improvement: Want help, feedback, or coaching on something?
